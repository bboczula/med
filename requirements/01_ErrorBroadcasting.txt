After pressing 'h', user should be able to see the last known error message.

If any address (even valid) is added to the command, there should be an error with reason "Uexcpected address".

If there were no previous errors, there should be no output.

If the error appears, user should see a quiestion mark and the error message should be stored.

The 'H' command should toggle between immediate error showing and showing on demand.

What we consider an error:
 - requested line address is out of range (less than zero or greater than current number of lines)
 - requested movement (f.e. '+' or '-' command) will be moved out of range
 - at least one of the requested addresses from a range is invalid
 - requested command is not known to med
 - 'h' command with any addres causes "Unexpected address"
